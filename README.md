Simple plant classification model

Author: Sanele Rudolph Mkhize

This is mini-project for image processing plant classification using leaves, University of KwaZulu-Natal. The source code used for this leaf classification have been acknowledged.The source code was adjusted accordingly to be used on a dataset obtained from leafsnap.  

Since the is a size limit on github for files you can upload, I created a shared drive if you want to execute the code yourself, the main reason is because of the dataset that is used for classification is huge or big.

The links to the shared drive, is included in the submission for Comp702, if you want to view the latex file, bibtex and all it also included in the shared file.

NB: You will need to include the packages, in order to use the model.
